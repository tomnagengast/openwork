# OpenWork Agent Guidelines



## Agent Docs
- **Assume NOT current.** Many docs describe historical features that may not exist in the codebase anymore.
- **Check the codebase first.** Before concluding something is or isn't truth, search the actual code. Docs describe behavior at a past point in time; code describes reality.
- **Use docs as guidance.**

## Specifications

**IMPORTANT:** Before implementing any feature, consult the specifications in `specs/README.md`.

- **Assume NOT implemented.** Many specs describe planned features that may not yet exist in the codebase.
- **Check the codebase first.** Before concluding something is or isn't implemented, search the actual code. Specs describe intent; code describes reality.
- **Use specs as guidance.** When implementing a feature, follow the design patterns, types, and architecture defined in the relevant spec.
- **Spec index:** `specs/README.md` lists all specifications organized by category (core, LLM, security, etc.).

## Plan Mode

- Make the plan extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
- At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if any.
